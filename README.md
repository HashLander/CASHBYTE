# CASHBYTE

CASHBYTE is a Komodo SmartChain and, by inheritance, a fork of Zcash. It supports both transparent and shielded transactions, offering optional privacy at the protocol level.

## Consensus Model

CASHBYTE uses a hybrid consensus mechanism:
- **55% Proof-of-Stake**
- **45% Proof-of-Work**

This model makes 51% attacks economically and practically unfeasible. All coinbase rewards require **20+ confirmations** to reach finality through `coinbase_maturity`.

## Key Specifications

- **Maximum Supply:** ~84,000,000 CBYTE  
- **Block Halving:** Every 3,000,000 blocks (≈ 4 years)  
- **Decimals:** 8 (Bitcoin-compatible)  
- **Token Support:** Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

## Motto

**BUILD. BUILD. BREATHE. BUILD MORE.**
